    <symbols count="4"><symbol type="2" id="0" code="101" name="Contour"><description>A line joining points of equal height. The standard vertical interval between contours is 2 or 2.5 m. To emphasize the 3-dimensional effect of the contour line image, contour lines shall be represented as continuous lines through all symbols, also building (526.1) and canopy (526.2). However, contour lines shall be cut out for better legibility, if they touch the following symbols: small earth wall (108.1), small knoll (112), small elongated knoll (113), small depression (115), pit or hole (116), prominent landform feature (118), step or edge of paved area (529.1). The relative height difference between neighbouring features must be represented on the map as accurately as possible.  Absolute height accuracy is of less importance. It is permissible to alter the height of a contour slightly if this will improve the representation of a feature. This deviation should not exceed 25% of the contour interval and attention must be paid to neighbouring features. The smallest bend in a contour is 0.4 mm from centre to centre of the lines.</description><line_symbol color="4" line_width="210" minimum_length="0" join_style="2" cap_style="1" pointed_cap_length="1000" segment_length="4000" end_length="0" show_at_least_one_symbol="true" minimum_mid_symbol_count="0" minimum_mid_symbol_count_when_closed="0" dash_length="4000" break_length="1000" dashes_in_group="1" in_group_break_length="500" mid_symbols_per_spot="1" mid_symbol_distance="0"/></symbol><symbol type="2" id="1" code="102" name="Index contour"><description>Every fifth contour shall be drawn with a thicker line.
